    }
}
```
Certificate Installation

The activity looks for the Aws device certificates in the same directory where the engine was started. Download the root CA certificate file and save it as "root-CA.pem.crt". Now place the cert and private key generated by Aws IoT for your thing  as device.pem.crt and device.pem.key respectively.

## Example Configurations

Triggers are configured via the triggers.json of your application. The following are some example configuration of the MQTT Trigger.

### Start a flow
Configure the Trigger to start "myflow". "settings" "topic" is the topic it uses to listen for incoming messages. So in this case the "endpoints" "settings" "topic" is "test_start" will start "myflow" flow. The incoming message payload has to define "replyTo" which is the the topic used to reply on.

```json
{
  "triggers": [
    {
      "name": "tibco-mqtt",
      "settings": {
        "topic": "flogo/#",
        "broker": "ssl://a3730revvijqbs.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883",
        "id": "flogo",
        "user": "",
        "password": "",
        "store": "",
        "qos": "0",
        "cleansess": "false"
      },
      "endpoints": [
        {
          "actionType": "flow",
          "actionURI": "embedded://myflow",
          "settings": {
            "topic": "test_start"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
